The purple cherry plum is a common ornamental tree in Albuquerque. Many people don't realize that the plums produced are perfectly edible and delicious when they soften in June.

If you like tart flavors, they're great fresh off the tree! For a sweeter treat, process them as you would cherries: they make a pie filling to die for.

Unfortunately, these trees are thirsty. In its [Climate-Ready Tree Guide](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/new-mexico/stories-in-new-mexico/plant-trees-to-fight-climate-change/), The Nature Conservancy recommends against planting them here, as they are vulnerable to drought and pests.
