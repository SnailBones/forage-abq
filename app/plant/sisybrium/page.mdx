# Samara Ratha

## _Sisymbrium irio_

Samara ratha (Arabic: سمارة رثة), London rocket, or wild arugula is an abundant mustard and winter weed in the city.

These leaves pack a wasabi-like bite. To some, it's an acquired taste, best used sparingly as an herb. Others love the spicy flavor and enjoy it as a salad green.

Samara ratha prefers disturbed, bare soil. Plants often grow larger and taste better in areas that receive some shade. Look on the north sides of walls for plants with large, tender leaves.

During dryer winters, samara ratha is found mostly in places that collect runoff or receive irrigation. Following heavy rain and snow, it grows ubiquitously.

Samara ratha can be confused with sow thistle (Sonchus sp.) or prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola), which can have similar leaf shapes. Sow thistle and prickly lettuce are edible but very bitter. They leak a white sap when cut, which samara ratha does not.

How did this desert plant gain the English name "London Rocket"? While this plant is neither native to nor adapted to Britain, it grew in abundance in London after the Great Fire of 1666, helped by the disturbance and perhaps the soil pH increase from ash. Its abundance was short lived, and today, it is rare in London. The plant has never been widely consumed or used in England.

We prefer the name سمارة رثة (samara ratha) used by the Bedouin and other Arabic-speaking peoples, who have long used this plant has long been used as food and medicine. British imperialism in Mandatory Palestine and its ongoing effects in Israel have often displaced these cultures and deprived them of foraging for traditional foods.
