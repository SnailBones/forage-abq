# Samara Ratha

## _Sisymbrium irio_

Samara ratha (Arabic: سمارة رثة), London rocket, or wild arugula is an abundant mustard and winter weed in the city.

These leaves pack a wasabi-like bite. To some, it's an acquired taste, best used sparingly as an herb. Others love the spicy flavor and enjoy it as a salad green.

Samara ratha prefers disturbed, bare soil. Plants often grow larger and taste better in areas that receive some shade. Look on the north sides of walls for plants with large, tender leaves.

During dryer winters, samara ratha is found mostly in places that collect runoff or receive irrigation. Following heavy rain and snow, it grows ubiquitously.

Samara ratha can be confused with sow thistle (Sonchus sp.) or prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola), which can have similar leaf shapes. Sow thistle and prickly lettuce are edible but very bitter. They leak a white sap when cut, which samara ratha does not.
