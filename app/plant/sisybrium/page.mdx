# Samara Ratha

## _Sisymbrium irio_

Samara ratha (Arabic: سمارة رثة), London rocket, or wild arugula is an abundant mustard and winter weed in the city.

These leaves pack a wasabi-like bite. To some, it's an acquired taste, best used in moderation as an herb. Others, like me, love the spicy flavor and enjoy it as a salad green.

Grows in disturbed, sandy areas. Plants tent to grow larger and taste better in areas that receive some shade. Look on the north sides of walls.

During dryer winters, samara ratha is found mostly in places that collect runoff or receive irrigation. Following heavy rain and snow, it grows ubiquitously.

Samara ratha can be confused with sow thistle (Sonchus sp.) or prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola), which can have similar leaf shapes. Both are edible but very bitter. Both leak a white sap when cut, which samara ratha does not.

Use as basil in pesto for a spicy twist.
