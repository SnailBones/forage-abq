## _Ulmus pumila_

Look out a window in Albuquerque or another western town, and there's a good chance you'll see a Siberian elm. Introduced to fight the dust bowl, these are a famously weedy tree that has reseeded itself throughout urban areas as well as wild habitats, especially the bosque. In early spring, they produce an abundance of bright green seed pods that are easily mistaken for leaves, called "samaras." They are edible and palatable with a mild, fresh leafy taste.

To harvest, simply strip the seeds from the branches. Don't worry if you get some leaves and flowers, they're edible too! This won't harm the tree (though if you take enough seeds, you might be able to reduce the number of weedy seedlings sprouting in the area!)

Pop them into your mouth for a fresh greens snack on a spring walk! But they really shine in a salad, or as a salad on their own: just add your favorite dressing! Or if you like your greens hot, throw in a bit of [khardal](sisybrium)!

The Siberian elm may be confused with the lacebark elm, as both species are sometimes known as "chinese elm," as are native to East Asia. Lacebark elms can be found as street trees in Albuquerque and lack their cousin's invasive habit. Their samaras are also edible.
