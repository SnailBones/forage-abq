## _Ulmus pumila_

What's your nearest tree? If you're in an older neighborhood in Albuquerque, there's a good chance it's a Siberian elm. Planted in mass throughout the West to fight the dust bowl, these trees have further seeded themselves throughout the landscape. They're especially abundant in the bosque, in many areas replacing native cottonwoods.

In early spring, elms turn green. Leaves? No: these electric green discs are **edible seed pods called samaras** with a mild, fresh leafy taste. Don't worry if you get some leaves and flowers, they're edible too. To harvest, simply strip the seeds from the branches. The tree won't be harmed, so don't be shy! Get them quick: in a few weeks they'll turn brown and crunchy, before they blow all over the neighborhood and sprout a weedy forest.

Pop elm seeds into your mouth for a fresh greens snack on a spring walk! But they really shine in a saladâ€”or as a salad, just add your favorite dressing. If you like your salad with a arugula-like kick, look for some [khardal barri](sisybrium) growing in the tree's shade; its season often peaks at the same time.

The Siberian elm may be confused with the lacebark elm, as both species are often called "Chinese elm," and both are native to East Asia. Lacebark elms can be found as occasional street trees in Albuquerque and lack their cousin's invasive habit, and are a better choice for planting. But you probably don't need to plant an elm for the seeds: more likely than not, a walk around your block will show you more elms than you can eat!
