# Nopales

### _Opuntia sp._

Prickly pears are a striking component of both wild and cultivated landscapes in the Southwest.

In late spring, new pads are a delicious vegetable called **nopales** and a key component of Mexican and New Mexican cuisine.

They're tart and slimy, much like the similarly succulent [verdolagas](portulaca). I love them fried in tacos, but there's countless ways to prepare them in Mexican cuisine. Slime can be reduced by thorough cooking.

Unfortunately, this delicious treat is covered in spines! Avoid most of them by harvesting from a near-spineless variety. Use tongs to remove them from the plant, then remove spines by laying the pad flat on a cutting board, running a sharp knife over it to scrape off the pad's nodes, and cutting off the pad's edges.

In the fall, plants produce fruit called **tuna**. Fruit is edible on all larger prickly pears, though some species produce sweeter fruit than others. Fruit can also be used for dye.

Prickly pears are among the easiest plants to propagate! Pads often root and grow after falling off the plant. To increase survival rate, give a pad two weeks to callous, then plant it slightly in the ground.

Our most common spineless variety is _Opuntia cacapana_ 'Ellisiana', which grows delicious nopales. It is often confused with _Opuntia ficus-indica_ 'Burbank Spineless', which is limited to warmer climates. [_O. cacapana_](https://www.opuntiads.com/opuntia-cacanapa-incl-o-ellisiana/) is native to Texas and Mexico, where the spineless 'Ellisiana' most likely arose from natural mutation. It's as spineless as cactuses get, though it still bears an occasional tiny spine (glochid). It produces little fruit.

Cholla flower buds are also edible and similarly tasty, but more difficult to de-spine.
