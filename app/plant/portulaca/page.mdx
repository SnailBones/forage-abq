# Verdolagas

### _Portulaca oleracea_

Verdolagas or purslane is an ephemeral succulent that grows with the monsoon rains. It's highly regarded in traditional New Mexican cooking and a component of indigenous diets throughout the world, as it grows almost everywhere!

Its flavor changes throughout the day: it tastes tart and fresh when picked in the morning.

It's delicious raw on sandwiches or in salads. It's also excellent stir-fried, or it can thicken soups with its mucilaginous quality! Slime-haters fear not, it's not as slimy as okra or nopales.

Don't mix it up with spurge! That's a similar looking plant that is mildly toxic. Spurge leaves are smaller and less succulent, and the plant leaks a milky sap.

Nor should it be confused it with the broader leaves of the similar-looking but unrelated horsepurslane (Trianthema portulacastrum). Horsepurslane is marginally edible but undelicious.

Purslane is found almost everywhere in the world, and predates Columbus in the Americas.
