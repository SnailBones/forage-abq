# Kochia

## _Bassia scoparia_

Kochia (sometimes incorrectly called "ragweed") is our less famous tumbleweed relative. This common weed is secret summer delicacy when cooked, with a flavor compared to grape leaves, olive oil, or nori.

Kochia **needs to be thoroughly cooked** to be palatable and safe to eat. Boil it briefly or fry it for a while (10+ minutes). When fully cooked, it changes color and will become soft if boiled. If it still tastes bitter, it's undercooked.

Plants can be fibrous. To harvest the leaves, be gentle. If a stem breaks off easily, it will be soft and good eating. If you pull too hard, you'll break of stems.

If it's still too fibrous, boil then run it through a blender. This makes for a delicious alternative to spinach for saag paneer.

Kochia is widespread and easy to find. It grows in the bosque, gardens, empty lots and alleyways. It prefers disturbed soil and is often found growing with [tumbleweeds](salsola) and goatheads and seasonally swapping places with [samara ratha](sisybrium).

Kochia is easily confused with our native purple aster (Dieteria canescens), especially when small. Look closely at leaf margins to differentiate them. Kochia leaves are also slightly fuzzy.

Kochia is a hyperaccumulator of lead. Avoid harvesting it near roads or gas stations.

In its native China and Japan, its cultivated for food and as an ornamental, and seeds are also eaten. Kochia was introduced to the US as an ornamental around 1900. Unfortunately, its food use isn''t widely known in the US, where it's usually regarded as a useless weed, or animal fodder at best.

Along with some other plants in the amaranth and tumbleweed family, kochia uses C4 photosynthesis, allowing it to grow more quickly and with less water than other plants.
