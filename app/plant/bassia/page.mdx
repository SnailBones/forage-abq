# Kochia

## _Bassia scoparia_

Kochia (sometimes incorrectly called "ragweed") is our less famous tumbleweed relative. This common weed is secret summer delicacy when cooked, with a flavor compared to grape leaves, olive oil, or nori.

Kochia **needs to be thoroughly cooked** to be palatable and safe to eat. I usually boil it for a few minutes or fry it for a while (at least 10 minutes). When cooked, it changes color and will become soft if boiled.

Plants can be fibrous. To harvest the leaves, be gentle. If a stem breaks off easily, it will be soft and good eating. If you pull too hard, you'll break of stems.

Alternatively, break up the fiber by running it through a blender after boiling. This makes for a delicious saag paneer, or use it any way you'd use blended spinach.

Kochia is widespread and easy to find. It grows in the bosque, gardens, empty lots and alleyways. It prefers disturbed soil and is often found growing with [tumbleweeds](salsola) and goatheads and seasonally swapping places with [samara ratha](sisybrium).

Kochia is easily confused with our native purple aster (Dieteria canescens), especially when small. Look closely at leaf margins to differentiate them. Kochia leaves are also slightly fuzzy.

In its native China and Japan, its cultivated for food and as an ornamental, and seeds are also eaten. Kochia was introduced to the US as an ornamental around 1900. Unfortunately, its food use isn''t widely known in the US, where it's usually regarded as a useless weed, or animal fodder at best.

Leaves are very high in protein. Chickens love it raw.
