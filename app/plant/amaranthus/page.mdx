# Amaranth

## _Amaranthus palmeri_

While often considered a weed, our common amaranth, _Amaranthus palmeri_ is a native plant, just one that thrives in disturbance..

The amaranth family includes spinanch and many of our local wild foods: [Quelites](chenopodium), [Tumbleweed](salsola), [Kochia](bassia).

Ensure that leaves are dry, then quickly fry them and add a pinch of salt or Tajin for a crunchy snack! Be careful not to burn them.

Amaranth can accumulate nitrates. Don't harvest if artificial fertilizers have been used.

C4 photosynthesis allows amaranths to grow faster than other plants and with less water.
