# Amaranth

## _Amaranthus palmeri_

While often considered a weed, our common amaranth, _Amaranthus palmeri_ is a native plant that thrives in disturbance and has adapted well to human-altred landscapes.

Use like spinach or quelites, or ensure that leaves are dry, then quickly fry them and add a pinch of salt or Tajin for a crunchy snack! Be careful not to burn them.

The amaranth family includes spinanch and many of our local wild foods: [Quelites](chenopodium), [Tumbleweed](salsola), [Kochia](bassia).

Amaranth can accumulate nitrates. Don't harvest if artificial fertilizers have been used.

Our native species has seperate male and female plants. Only males produce allergenic pollen, however females get prickly as they mature.

C4 photosynthesis allows amaranth to grow faster than other plants and with less water.
