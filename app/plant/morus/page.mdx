A sweet treat, abundant in the bosque at the start of summer.

Mulberries are a common street tree in Albuquerque's older neighborhoods. Most large planted trees are fruitless males, but female fruiting trees can occasionally be found planted or as volunteers. They've escaped cultivation and grow in many parts of the bosque, e.g. near Tingley beach.

Berry flavor and color varies greatly between trees.

Mulberries have been banned for planting by the city for their allergenic pollen. Unfortunately, this ban applies to all plants of all species, even though female fruiting trees produce little or no pollen.

Albuquerque's mulberries are the non-native "White mulberry" (_Morus alba_). Confusingly, fruits are sometimes white but more often purple or black. In Southern NM, we have a shrubby native mulberry: _Morus microphylla._
