The mulberry! Ah, that magnificent messy matriarch making many moist, mild morsels mid-May through midsummer.

As the heat of summer is upon us, so are mulberries. While the berries resemble blackberries, they grow on trees and have a much sweeter flavor.

Mulberry trees are a common street tree in Albuquerque's older neighborhoods. Most large planted trees are fruitless males, but female fruiting trees can occasionally be found planted or as volunteers. They've escaped cultivation and grow in many parts of the bosque, where they can be foraged in abundance.

Berry flavor, sweetness and color varies greatly between trees. If you don't like one, try another!

Mulberries have been banned for planting by the city for their allergenic pollen. Unfortunately, this ban applies to all plants and all species, even though fruit-producing female trees produce little or no pollen.

Planted and wild mulberry trees in Albuquerqueare the non-native "white mulberry," common mulberry or Russian mulberry (_Morus alba_). In spite of the name, fruits may be white, purple or black. In Southern NM, we have a shrubby native mulberry: _Morus microphylla._
