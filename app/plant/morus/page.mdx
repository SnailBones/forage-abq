The mulberry! Ah, that magnificent messy matriarch, maker of many moist, mild morsels mid-May through midsummer.

As the heat of summer is upon us, so are mulberries. While the berries resemble blackberries, they grow on trees and have a sweeter flavor with no acidic tang.

Mulberry trees are a common street tree in Albuquerque's older neighborhoods. Unfortunately, planted trees are most often fruitless males. Female trees in fruit can be spotted from a distance by the purple stain on the sidewalk beneath! They can also be easily found in some parts of the bosque, where they have escaped cultivation and grow in abundance.

Berry flavor, size and color varies greatly between trees. If you don't like one, try another!

Mulberries have been banned for planting by the city for their allergenic pollen. Sadly, this ban applies to all plants and all species, even though fruit-producing female trees produce little or no pollen. But there's no city ban on grafting a fruiting branch to a fruitless tree!

Planted and wild mulberry trees in Albuquerqueare the non-native "white mulberry," common mulberry or Russian mulberry (_Morus alba_). In spite of the name, fruits may be white, purple or black. In Southern NM, we have a shrubby native mulberry: _Morus microphylla._
