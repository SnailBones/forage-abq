# Tumbleweed

### _Salsola tragus_

The famous tumbleweed or Russian Thistle (Salsola tragus) is edible before it becomes prickly.

It was accidentally introduced in the 1870s and soon rolled its way across the west.

Tumbleweeds have a complex relationship with humans and native species. Their prickles are unpleasant and they can be dangerous as a fire hazard. Nonetheless, they are eaten by many animals and they can help regenerate barren soil.
