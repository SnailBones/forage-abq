The famous tumbleweed or Russian Thistle (Salsola tragus) is edible before it becomes prickly.

Growing tips from small plants have a tart, salty flavor and can be eaten raw or cooked.

It was accidentally introduced in the 1870s and quickly rolled its way across the west.

Tumbleweeds have a complex relationship with humans and native species. Their prickles are unpleasant and piles can become a fire hazard. Nonetheless, they are eaten by many animals and they can help regenerate barren soil.
