# Tumbleweed

### _Salsola tragus_

The famous tumbleweed or Russian Thistle (Salsola tragus) is edible before it becomes prickly.

It was accidentally introduced in the 1870s and soon rolled its way across the west. Tumbleweeds are extremely genetically diverse, and there may be 4 or more species and hybrids in the US.
