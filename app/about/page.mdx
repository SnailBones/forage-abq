## About Me

![It's me](/assets/aidan/aidan.jpg)

Hi there! I'm Aidan.

My hometown is the high desert city of Albuquerque, New Mexico. I've always loved the plants that grow here: their unique beauty, the unique wildlife they support, and of course their numerous unique flavors!

Foraging is a big part of my dietâ€”except for an occasional Chinese cabbage, I haven't bought greens since 2018. I've had the honor of learning about our edible plants from knowledgeable people of many different backgrounds. I made this site to share what I've learned.

I'm still learning! If you have knowledge to share, corrections, or suggestions, please open an issue on the project's [Github](https://github.com/SnailBones/forage-abq) or just reach out below!
