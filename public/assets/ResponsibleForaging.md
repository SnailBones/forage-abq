## Acknowledgements

Albuquerque exists on the unceded land of the Tiwa-speaking Pueblo people, specifically the Sandia and Isleta Pueblos.

The uses of plants is indigenous knowledge. Whether the Pueblo people who continue to steward the Rio Grande valley and harvest [amaranth](/plant/amaranthus), [quelites](/plant/chenopodium), and [verdolagas](plant/portulaca), the Bedouin of the Sinai and Palestine for their use of [khardal barri](plant/sisybrium), or numerous east Asian cultures for [kochia](/plant/bassia) and [Siberian elm](/plant/ulmus), we are grateful for their knowledge and stewardship.

## Responsible Foraging

By drawing sustenance from the place where we live and the other species that share it with us, we continue symbiotic relationships that our species—like every other—has always participated in. Foraging builds appreciation for and understanding of our "weedy" neighbors and the often-overlooked areas where they grow through the joys of multisensory experience and the intimacy of food.

This site lists only non-native and abundant "weedy" native species. If done with care, foraging for these species can provide fresh food while reducing our reliance on resource-intensive supply chains. Here are some guidelines on sustainability:

- **Take only what you will use**. Leave most plants for others, wildlife, and so the plants themselves can continue to grow and reproduce. Often, processing and cooking your foraged food will take much longer than harvesting them, so don't get carried away!
- **Cut, don't pull**. Even if you're harvesting a non-native weed, pulling disturbs soil life and can contribute to erosion.
- **Learn the natives.** If you harvest native plants, do so with extra restraint and care. Better yet, consider growing them in a garden.
- **Don't spread invasives.** Harvest non-native plants before they go to seed. Take care not to spread seeds to new areas. Watch out for goatheads on your shoes!

Stay safe! A few basic precautions:

- **If you're not sure, don't eat it.** Some plants have toxic lookalikes. Ask an expert if you're not sure, and don't eat anything that tastes bitter or unusual.
- **Try a small amount first.** Even if your ID is correct, you could be allergic.
- **Don't get lead poisoned.** Wash thoroughly. Avoid plants growing near busy streets or gas stations, where leaded gasoline may have contaminated the soil.
- **Avoid pesticides and fertilizers.** Some weeds can accumulate toxic levels of nitrates when fertilized.
