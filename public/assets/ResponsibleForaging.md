## Acknowledgements

Albuquerque exists on the unceded land of the Tiwa-speaking Pueblo people, specifically the Sandia and Isleta Pueblos.

The uses of plants are indigenous knowledge. Whether the Pueblo people who continue to steward the Rio Grande valley and harvest [amaranth](/plant/amaranthus), [quelites](/plant/chenopodium), and [verdolagas](plant/portulaca), or the Bedouin of the Sinai and Palestine for their use of [samara ratha](plant/sisybrium), we are grateful for their knowledge and stewardship.

## Responsible Foraging

By drawing sustenance from the place where we live and the other species that share it with us, we continue a symbiotic relationships that our species—like every other—has always participated in. Foraging builds respect and care for our "weedy" neighbors and the often-overlooked areas where they grow through multisensory understanding and physical connection.

This site lists only non-native and abundant "weedy" native species. If done sustainably, foraging for these species can provides us with fresh food year-round while reducing our reliance on resource-intensive supply chains. Here are some guidelines on sustainability:

- **Take only what you will use**. Leave most plants for others, wildlife, and so the plants themselves can continue to grow and reproduce. Most often, processing and cooking your foraged food will take much longer than harvesting them, so don't get carried away!
- **Cut, don't pull**. Even if you're harvesting a non-native weed, pulling disturbs soil life and can contribute to erosion.
- **Learn which plants are native.** If you harvest native plants, do so with extra restraint and care. Better yet, consider growing them in a garden.
- **Don't spread invasive plants.** Harvest non-native plants before they go to seed. Take care not to spread seeds to new areas. Clean your shoes frequently, and watch out for goatheads!

Stay safe! A few basic precautions:

- **If you're not sure, don't eat it.** Some plants have toxic lookalikes. ID your plants carefully, and don't eat anything that tastes bad or unexpected.
- **Try a small amount first.** Even if your ID is correct, you could be allergic.
- **Don't get lead poisoned.** Wash thoroughly. Avoid plants growing near busy streets or gas stations, where leaded gasoline may have contaminated the soil.
- **Avoid pesticides and fertilizers.** Some weeds can accumulate toxic levels of nitrates when fertilized.
