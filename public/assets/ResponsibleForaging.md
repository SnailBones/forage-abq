## Responsible Foraging

Foraging allows us to relate to the natural world in a physical way. By drawing sustenance from the place where we live and the other species that share it with us, we build a deeper connection and multisensory understanding of them. We practice mutual care and symbiosis with other species, as our species—and every species—has always done.

This site lists only non-native and/or abundant "weedy" species. Nonetheless, please forage with respect for the habitats that are sustaining you. Here are some guidelines:

- **Take only what you will use**. Leave most plants for others, wildlife, and so the plants themselves can continue to grow and reproduce. Most foraged foods require processing that can take much longer than the picking itself, so you'll be saving yourself time.
- **Cut, don't pull**. Even if you're harvesting a non-native weed, pulling disturbs the soil, which can harm native plants growing nearby or contribute to erosion.
- **Learn which plants are native.** If you harvest native plants, do so with extra restraint and care. Better yet, consider growing them in a garden.

It's also a good idea to follow basic safety precautions:

- **If you're not sure, don't eat it.** Some plants have toxic lookalikes. Don't eat any plant with milky sap or a bitter taste.
- **Try a small amount first.** Even if your ID is correct, you could be allergic to a plant or not like it.
- **Don't get lead poisoned.** Avoid plants growing near busy streets or gas stations, where leaded gasoline may have accumulated.
- **Avoid pesticides and fertilizers.** Some weeds can accumulate dangerous levels of nitrates when fertilized.
