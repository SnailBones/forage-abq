Samara ratha (Arabic: سمارة رثة), London rocket, or wild arugula is an abundant mustard and winter weed in urban spaces.

These leaves pack a wasabi-like bite. To some, it's an acquired taste, best used in moderation as an herb. Others, like me, love the spicy flavor and enjoy it as a salad green.

Grows in disturbed, sandy areas. Plants tent to grow larger and taste better in areas that receive some shade. Look on the north sides of walls.

Following heavy rain and snow, samara ratha grows ubiquitously. During dryer years, it's found mostly in places that collect runoff or recieve irrigation.
