Verdolagas—also known as *purslane*—is a slow-growing succulent that merges with monsoon rains.

Its flavor changes throughout the day: it tastes tart and most fresh when picked in the morning.

It's delicious fresh and raw on sandwiches or in salads. It's also good cooked.

Purslane is found almost everywhere in the world, and predates Columbus in the Americas.

C4 + CAM photosysnthesis, switches depending on water availability.
