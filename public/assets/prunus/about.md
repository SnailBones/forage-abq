The purple cherry plum is a popular ornamental tree in Albuquerque. Many people don't realize that the plums produced are perfectly edible and delicious.

If you like tart flavors, they're great fresh off the tree! For a sweeter treat, process them as you would cherries. After pitting with a cherry pitter, they make an incredible pie filling.

Unfortunately, these trees are thirsty. In its [Climate-Ready Tree Guide](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/new-mexico/stories-in-new-mexico/plant-trees-to-fight-climate-change/), The Nature Conservancy recommends against planting them here, as they are vulnerable to drought and pests.
