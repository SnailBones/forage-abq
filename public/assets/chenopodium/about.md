Quelites (Spanish, pronounced “keh-LEE-tays”) or lambsquarters is a common garden weed with a long history of use in New Mexico.

Leaves can be eaten raw but are better cooked in large quantities. Use it how you use spinach: fried with onions and garlic is a popular choice.

In Mexico, the term "quelites" refers to a any wild green, including [amaranth](amaranthus) and [verdolagas](portulaca). But here in New Mexico, it's specific to chenopodiums. Across the rest of the USA, this plant is most commonly called lambsquarters, and it's found almost everywhere in the world.

We also have several native species in the area, but the non-native Chenopodium album is by far the most ubiquitous.

One of these wild species, _C. berlandieri_, is an ancient food throughout the Americas, independently domesticated by 4000 BC in Eastern North America as well as in Mexico as _huauzontle_, among the most important crops for the Aztecs that is still grown today. Quinoa likely originated from the same wild species in the Andes.
